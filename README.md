# Printoid Languages

This public repository contains the string resources for the internationalization of Printoid for OctoPrint.

## Contributing

Everyone can contribute to the internationalization of Printoid, by editing the existing language files or adding translations to a new locale.

All the informations are available on the official website:

[Contribute to the internationalization of Printoid](https://printoid.net/contribute-to-the-internationalization-of-printoid/)

If you want to contribute to the Printoid project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github.

## Prerequisites

You don't need to be a developer to help me to translate Printoid :) You don't need any programming skills. You just have to edit XML files which contains the string resources (the words, sentences, etc. used in the application).

### Where are located the resources

The resources are located in the **/app/src/main/res/** folder.

- **values** contains the default values, in English
- **values-fr** contains the values translated in French
- **values-de** contains the values translated in German
- **values-es** contains the values translated in Spanish
- **values-ru** contains the values translated in Russian
- **values-nl** contains the values translated in Dutch
- **values-pt** contains the values translated in Portuguese
- **values-it** contains the values translated in Italian

### Create translations to a new language

To create the translations to a new language, you need to create a new folder in **/app/src/main/res/**.

For example, to introduce these new languages:

- **values-da** for Danish translations
- **values-pl** for Polish translations
- **values-ja** for Japanese translations
- ...

Then, copy all the **xml** files from an existing folder. For example:
- if you want to translate from English to Japanese, then copy the files from **values** to **values-ja**
- if you want to translate from French to Polish, then copy the files from **values-fr** to **values-pl**
- ...

Please, don't rename the files. Keep the files name (the strings are ordered by app features).

### Some translation examples

**A basic example**

In the file *values*/string_connect.xml :

```
<string name="connection_dialog_title">Connection to your server</string>
<string name="connection_dialog_message">Printoid is connecting to your server, please wait...</string>
```

The translation in french would look like, in **values-fr**/string_connect.xml :

```
<string name="connection_dialog_title">Connexion au serveur</string>
<string name="connection_dialog_message">Printoid se connecte Ã  votre serveur, veuillez patienter...</string>
```

Please, don't rename the resource's names. You should only translate what's inside the ...> </string>

**An example with qualifiers**

Sometimes you will find some exotic characters, such as %d, %s, %.1f. These are qualifiers, where Printoid will inject dynamic values. For example:

```
<string name="config_say_hello">Hello %s!</string>
```

should be translated in french as:

```
<string name="config_say_hello">Bonjour %s !</string>
```

so Printoid will be able to inject the username, for example: "Hello Patrick!" and "Bonjour Patrick !"

Some qualifiers also have index to order the dynamic values: %1$s, %2$s, %3%s. For example:

```
<string name="config_introduce_developer">The developer is %1$s, and he is %2$d.</string>
```

should be translated in french as:

```
<string name="config_introduce_developer">Le dÃ©veloppeur s\'appelle %1$s, et il a %2$d ans.</string>
```

**Character escapments**

And, last but not least, some characters have to be escaped, such as quotes. To escape a character, you have to add a backslash in front of it.

```
<string name="config_introduce_developer_age">He\'s 27 years old.</string>
```

And for carriage returns, that's **\n** :

```
<string name="connection_progress_dialog_message">The app is trying to communicates with your 3D printer.\nYou can drink a coffee for the next 2 seconds.</string>
```

## How to contribute

Please follow these indications if you want to contribute to the internationalization of Printoid.

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- Add the original repository as a remote called `upstream`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on from `master`.
- Implement/fix the language files
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `develop` branch if there is one, else go for `master`!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
